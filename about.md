Hi there, I'm Nodetator. I am an aspiring independent analyst. What does that mean?

I try to read and dissect a bunch of stuff and articulate it in writing, hopefully in a way that a 12 year old understands

My principal interests now are: Defi Protocol Mechanisms and Public Technology Companies 

I share my thoughts (including personal ones) on this website

I can be contacted on Twitter.
