**Nodetator's Area of Interests**
This blogposts series will be updated regularly, it tracks down my areas of interests at any given moment. Lately, I have been feeling a little overwhelmed and thinking of how I consume information. The Information Age seems to be growing at an exponential rate, Instagram, TikTok, SnapChat, Blogs, Newsletters, Tweets (I am addicted to Twitter), somehow scrolling an app for hours a day is not the best use of my time, I know that, clearly, but it already forms a key part of who I am. People used to read newspapers and watch the television for hours a day in order to keep up with the news/entertainment, I don't think that's available for my generation. I'm still struggling ot balance my reading and being addicted to doomscrolling on Twitter.

I think the key is thinking of better ways to consume information, and really synthesize concepts and articulate them, that's my hypothesis for surviving in the Information Age. With that long rant out of the way, here are some of the areas I am paying extra attention to: 

**Technology**
Pretty straightforward, I like technology, a lot. I like smartphones, video games, mobile operating systems, and crypto. This is where the future is headed, and software isn't slowing down in its journey to devour the world. 

**Venture Capital**
Venture Capital is betting on the future, what other job is as cool as being a professional tarot card reader, and it is incredibly lucrative.

**Corporate Situations**
A note on terminology, I have been moderately successful in the past 2,3 years in placing bets in companies undergoing some corporate exercises. Ocassionally I can find that the odds implied in the market, and the value I can get in betting against it exists. Will pay extra attention to this area moving forward.

**Mining Speculation**
I stumbled upon a Twitter account @Respeculator which shares plenty of mining/materials related news on compaines. The account is part of a community of mining/materials speculator, seems interesting, will follow and provide extra updates.


**Some areas I am discarding**
- Energy: Was trying  to get educated on the topic since a few months back, I find that politics, especially those surrounding climate change has obscured any rational discussion in this space. I have yet to find any good resources/experts that provide a clear view on energy policy. Best to avoid, I rather have no opinions than faulty ones
- Investing: I was pretty into investing since college, but lately I have found the exercise pretty futile. Just imagine the lives lost on people being addicted to investing. It is so similar to gambling that it isn't funny. I don't want to be the next addicted gambler/investor. Also, FinTwit is horrible, everyone is pumping their bags, again, impossible to get any sort of rational discussion.
- Politics: I avoid this like the plague, the only material I read that is remotely close to politics are the Hansard Parliamentary Debates of Singapore. I think it contains the highest singal/noise ratio of reading material there is. Speeches are made by an incredibly calibre of exceptional people. I recommend it to anyone interested in learning about finance, economy and governance of a country.
