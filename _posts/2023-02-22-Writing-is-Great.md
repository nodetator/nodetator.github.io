For the past several months, I have been writing about lots of stuff. I'd like to think that my writing has improved significantly due to this exercise.

Ideas come up quicker, and the actual typing on a keyboard is faster too. My thoughts and thinking on various subjects have been sharpened because of the writing I do. The struggle of writing something, of thinking up better words to craft a sentence, helps in clarifying and synthesizing your unstructured mind. 

My reading habits are a mess, I read books, blogs, articles, newspapers and Twitter. Due to this unstructured and random information diet, it is quite easy to get lost. I have no idea what I actually understand until I have actually written it down. So writing helps in guiding my reading and thinking.

So how do I actually write these shitty posts? I don't spend alot of time editing them, I usually write a post within 30 minutes and just post it. I don't care that they are shitty, I will improve on the next one. It probably helps that no one is actually reading this blog, so Im less self conscious and am able to actually get the volume out. I also write very short blog posts, that helps as a beginner writer, instead of something daunting like a chapter of a book or an essay that is to be published in some publications.

In short, I love writing and will continue to keep this habit up in 2023. But Im going to change up on the type of writing I do, I'll still have personal reflections and thoughts like this post, but I'm moving towards writing more deep diving articles and essays on the topic which I am passionate in, technology.
