I like bear markets more than bull markets. No more grifters, scammers, or idiots reminding you how you are missing out on crazy APYs. No longer is there the constant rush to keep up with your Twitter Feed, Discord or Telegram.

The TradFi Bros leave DeFi, Influencers leave NFTs, and builders can finally build in peace. The Corporatist and Elitist culture gets eradicated from Crypto.

We haven’t been in a bear market that long, there are remnants of the culture I dislike. Retail still think they should buy the dip, some still think NFTs are can store value. I hope the bear markets last for the next 3 years, that’s where opportunities present itself to those who truly want to be in this space.

You the reader should first decide whether you are a mercenary or actually in Crypto for the long haul.
