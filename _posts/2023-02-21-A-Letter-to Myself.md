**A Letter to Myself**

I'm 25 now and I just lost my job in October 2022, so I've been unemployed for the past 4 months. In terms of personal finances, thank god I saved up some money enough to sustain myself for at least 6 months, so no problems there. However, I'm not too sure what's my next step here. I feel really jaded at the career that I chose when I was 18, I dedicated the past 6 years to train as a lawyer. But I don't want to do that anymore.

Increased and increasing competition, downward price pressure on low-level work, incredibly stupid work culture, cutthroat environment. Basically a pie eating contest where the winner gets to eat more pie, that's a very accurate description of the legal profession.

Of course, I still have some hesitatation in quitting completely. The sunk-cost of my entire adult life (albeit short adult life, I am only 25) is clouding my judgment here, I am basically paralysed by what's next. Hence, I wrote this post to vent. 

I am considering some alternatives, but it isn't easy to decide, I am in the dilemma of not having enough career capital or a strong network to depend on to throw opportunities my way. It's a chicken and egg problem. 

I also sort of had a minor markets addiction, mainly in crypto and traditional markets, for the past 3 years which I am trying to quit now. So hopefully life gets better from here on out. 

**What's next**

I'm not too sure, but I want to stay and positive. I will be sending out my resume to a bunch of organisations and different roles, see what opportunities are out there. But I'd like to remind myself of certain life principles in these difficult times (I'm perhaps a tad bit too dramatic).

Principles:
- Getting Rid of Envy: Envy drives the world. [Charlie Munger is absolutely right](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/10/billionaire-charlie-munger-world-is-driven-by-envy-not-greed.html) in saying that the world isn't driven by greed, it's driven by envy. So getting rid of envy means I will have a huge advantage in developing a strong psychological fortitude. It also helps that getting rid of envy automatically boosts your happiness levels. 
- [Climbing the wrong hill](https://cdixon.org/2009/09/19/climbing-the-wrong-hill): Chris Dixon said that early on in your career, make sure to explore a little to make sure that you are not climbing the wrong hill. This is exactly my position right now, so I have decided that my 20s are most likely a time for exploration, I won't be making a lot of money, but I think its worth it. Careers are getting longer, I don't retiring at 50 or 55 is doable anymore, people just live longer now, so I have a 40~45 year career in front of me, I do not want to stay in an industry when I hate the work.
- Extreme Frugality - Frugality is a virtue. I have found that the best things in life for me, that I enjoy, do not generally require a big spending. I like reading, it's mostly free or costs next to nothing. I really love spending quality time with my girlfriend watching thrashy shows or Netflix. I love writing this blog, again, it's free. Furthermore, I have found that frugality gives you more freedom and mental breathing space. As written, I am currently unemployed, but I basically have no stress. Why? I cook my own food, I use a cheap android phone instead of an iphone, I have not bought a single piece of clothing for myself for the past 3 years. It's pretty amazing how frugality can go such a long way. By the way, if [Warren Buffet can be so frugal](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/03/9-of-warren-buffetts-funniest-and-most-frugal-quirks.html), I really have no excuse right?

**Concluding thoughts**

Overall, I am in a flux state now. A neither here or there place. I will provide updates when I get a new job, hopefully it's a good one. Thanks for reading.
