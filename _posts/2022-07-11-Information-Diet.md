The 21st Century is a century of abundance, not scarcity. Same goes for our information diet.

By information diet, I mean the stuff that you read/listen/watch on a day-to-day basis.

Social Media peppers us with tons of irrelevant and clickbaity doomdays news. If your information sources are moslty from Social Media. You're in trouble.

You will talk like the crowd does, act like the crowd does, and ultimately make key decisions as the crowd does.

I contend that one of the real moats an individual can develop in the Information Age is the curation/synthesization of information. 

I have yet to see a tech product which does this well. I know that there are RSS readers, Email Newsletters, Social Media etc. But there is not a single app/website which curates
quality content in a simple intutive UI with superior UX experience.

As for me personally, my information diet and things I am interested of consist of either very old things, cutting-edge technology, or science. I read/google/find out from a variety of sources topics that I am interested in, the sources can be from books, magazines, blogs, newsletters and yes, Twitter. Some examples:

Very old things
- History (Modern History of China, Roman Empire, Byzantium Empire, Ottoman Empire)
- Languages 

Cutting-edge technology
- Crypto/Web 3
- Software Engineering
- Artificial Intelligence (though I think it is still a hyped-up term, for now)
- Tech Blogs

Science
- Evolutionary Biology
- Behavioural Science & Decision Making Theory

I rarely keep up with any politics (whether domestic or international), I don't read macro news about markets, they do not provide any useful insights, most of it are not even interesting. Twitter can be a double edged sword, unfortunately, most people on Twitter write for the clout and not for an intrinsic purpose. I am ruthless in unfollowing accounts which 'shitposts', I really am looking for more well thought out content (PS: I find long form blogs with posts in the 1000~3000 word length the best bang for your buck, but these can be hard to find.)
