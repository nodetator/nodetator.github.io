# Software and Jobs

It was 11 years ago since Marc Andreessen penned this piece - [Why Software is Eating the World](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460). It's amazing to look back and realize how prescient that article was.  Software has indeed eaten the world, it has change the way we live, work, play, rest and just about everything of our lives.  

11 years ago I just started middle school, I was carefully insulated from the entire software revolution (though I was exposed to the Internet at a young age), and man has the world change since! 

Social Media, Cryptocurrencies, AirBNB, Uber, Google Maps, and a myriad of apps and websites to keep you busy 24/7!

What is the future? Specifically I want to explore how Software will change the most important thing we do - Work 

***The Past 10 Years***
The past 10 years we have seen how Software has disrupted entrenched industries. There will never be new taxi drivers anymore anywhere (Uber), the most desirable job for young people is to be an influencer (think Tik Tok, Instagram, the word 'influencer' wasn't a thing when I started middle school), and Programmers have risen to the ranks of Masters of the Universe. I could probably literally give another 100 or 1000 examples of Software changing the way we work. But I rest my case here.

***What is a job anyway?***
Jobs have literally been the identity of who we are, at least for adults for the past 50 years, will Software change this? I hope so. The Internet Revolution gave rise to previously unheard of jobs, here are a few of my favourites:

 - Bloggers (some of my favourites include [Ben Thompson's Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/), [Tim Urban's Wait but Why, ](https://waitbutwhy.com/), also see this piece of how [Multicoin Capital founders got their start as investors by.... blogging!](https://www.readthegeneralist.com/briefing/multicoin-capital-1)
 - Journalist (just Google 'substack journalists')
 - Podcasters (Tim Feriss & Joe Rogan)

Just imagine the myriad of careers out there waiting to be discovered, yet, as I suspect, most high school/college students when asked what their ideal careers will be answers: "Doctor, Lawyer, Nurse, Teacher, Journalist, Media Anchor". Well kids, by the time you finish university and start applying for jobs, publishing houses and TV businesses aren't hiring anymore, why? Revenues are down because of Software. Doctors hate their lives, lawyers more so, nurses and teachers are grossly underpaid, and frankly, I suspect very few people out there are actually passionate about these jobs.

***So what's the alternative?***
I can give some advice, and this is the course of action I intend to take as someone fresh (less than 1  year) out of university - Explore the Internet! 

The best career for you likely doesn't exist yet, or exist in some small obscure niche that is underexplored, or the best career might be waiting for you to create it. I remain optimistic, and I will share my journey exploring the Internet (as a career) right here, you can follow me on Twitter where I share updates.
