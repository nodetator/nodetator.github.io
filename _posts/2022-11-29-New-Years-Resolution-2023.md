As 2022 comes to and end, I share a few resolutions for 2023 that I am personally setting for myself. I want 2023 to be less goal-oriented and more habits-oriented, in between personal goals I set for myself, I want to focus on developing good habits, as long as I follow these habits regularly. Lets's Start:

### Resolution 1: Exercise More

I turn 25 in 2023 and I am currently in the worst shape I have ever been in my life, I am the heaviest I have ever been (76 kg), I can't run more than 3 kilometers without taking a break. My muscles have basically atrophied and been replaced with fat. My diet is fairly balanced, but I still consumed too much sugary drinks and snacks. 

So in 2023 I want to set a habit of taking care of my body better, specifically targeting my cardiovascular health, lifting heavy weights and getting a better diet. I am still looking for ways to try and exercise more. Something needs to change and I want to feel better, have more energy, and just look more like a fit human being than a couch potato.

### Resolution 2: Reading and Writing More

Other than taking care of my body, what's next is to take care of my mind. In contrast to my body, my mind is in good shape, in 2022 I have focused on reading a wide range of materials ranging from books, articles, blog posts and newspapers in various different subject areas (cryptocurrency, technology, economics, politics). 2022 was a fairly good year for my mind.

But continous improvement is still required, in 2023 I want to write more, I find writing, even silly blog posts like this one, really helps in articulating and distilling thoughts. Whenever I feel like I understood something, trying to write about it really humbles me, it just forces you to research and read with a critical eye and helps to really turn those gestating thoughts in your mind into words. So 2023 will be a year of various blog posts.

Furthermore, I have recently tried (actually retried) to learn to code, in 2023 I want to do more of that. I do not foresee becomming a professional software engineer/programmer anytime soon. I view coding and computer science to be a part of the liberal arts, ie required to become a good democratic citizen. Software ate and continues to eat the world, learning to code is the language to the future. 

### Resolution 3: Career

Minor setback on my career in 2022, wasn't accepted to my previous employer following a training program, was told that I was just "going through the motions" and was told to find something I am truly passionate about. Honestly, I agree with that assessment, it felt good to not be accepted there, I can move on now. 

But I do have many weaknesses to improve, I think I possess enough of raw cognitive brainpower to excel in certain fields, what I need to change is my intrinsic motivation and communication skills.

### Resolution 4: My Internet Career

Now, to the most exciting part of 2023. I see a huge demand for crypto research done analytically and with a focus on business strategy. The business/strategy side of crypto isn't explored well, devs generally do not spend enough time in communicating how the protocols or companies work. People in the business side do not understand the technical side of crypto well enough to communciate the nuances to the public. Finally, 2022 has probably shown that if crypto as an industry wants to advance, there is a definite to become more 
'professional', no stupid NFT jpeg nonsense, no heavy bag-shilling. 

There is a need for an independent, analytical and strategy-focused analyst spot on the internet.

I am still figuring out how to execute on the idea, I still think the newsletter and blog format is the best for this, most newsletters/blogs either lean too heavily on the news side or just give a broad overview of crypto while saying things like "Oh yeah, crypto is definitely the future but I can't give a single use case now", techno-optimism is good but we have enough of that. 

Just some random things to do for the idea:
- Design Homepage
- Business Logo and Name
- Strategic Viewpoints: How do I provide value and edge to readers?
- Frequency of Research, Format of Research exciting
- News-drive AND Analysis on Sectors
- No bag-shilling, only DCA-ing into blue chips (BTC and ETH, yes, I am willing to defend this position)


### Conclusion

Those are my 4 resolutions going into 2023, I will continue to share my nonsensical thoughts here. Not sure how many people will be reading this, but if you ever get interested in what I have to say, follow me on Twitter.
