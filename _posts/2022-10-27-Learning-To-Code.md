I just finished a trainee program at my first job out of college, I will be temporarily unemployed until I get my next job. But no worries! I have more than 6 months living expenses saved up, so I plan to take these short hiatus from my career to really learn some new stuff and take care of my body through exercise and proper nutrition.

To fill up the time, I am learning to code, not because I want to become a software engineer, because coding is the new literacy. I have always been pretty tech-savvy, but now I am diving deep. I am already seeing the benefits from just knowing the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript, Github is also a immensely useful resource, even as a non-Programmer.

To learn to code, I am currently going through [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), it’s pretty great. It teaches you web development,  using a bunch of tools like the command line and Github extensively, in contrast to most coding resources that really dumb it down for ya. The next few posts are going to probably revolve around my journey of learning to code, I also plan to dive deep on various 'fancy' technologies and might write about those (Blockchains, AI/Machine Learning, Sports Analytics).

Below I share some notes for myself, these are mostly troubling concepts which I had struggled with, but that is normal, learning anything new requires that one goes through this painful period. The concepts are:

-   CSS Selectors - Why is it so complicated to ‘select’ something to ‘style’?
-   CSS rules - which one applies? (PS: the most specific one will apply)
-   Referencing Source: The Odin Project explains fairly well the rules on CSS
-   What is a cascade or cascading? What does it even mean?
-   Box model - why is everything a box, how important is it to be able to understand the box model? 
-   Margin, Border, Paddings - really? like sometimes I feel that learning anything new requires you to just get your head around the fancy lingo that the field uses.

PS: I am also exploring a career as an analysts at a buy-side fund, will share updates if I have any
