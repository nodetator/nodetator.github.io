This is the wisest passage I have ever come across in my life, just thought it would be good to share it:

*"I wouldn't call myself an atheist. I neither deny nor accept that there is a God. The universe, they say, came out of the Big Bang. But human beings on this earth have developed over the last 20,000 years into thinking beings, and are able to see beyond themselves and think about themselves. Is that a result of Darwininan evolution? Or is it God? I do not know. So I do not laugh at people who believe in God. But I do not necessarily believe in God - nor deny that there could be one."*
