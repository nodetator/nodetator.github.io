What is the thesis for Apple for the next 10 years? There are way better Apple analysts out there, but this is my humble attempt in summarizing the bull case of Apple.

* Consumers have shown a fanatical obsession over Apple products
* Apple's Pricing Power is unmatched (a short thought experiment: if Apple raise their prices on all products by 30%, what are the alternatives consumer would go for, I surmise, none)
* Untapped markets: Emerging Markets are still a largely unsaturated market for Apple products, with Apple's strategy of releasing different tiers of the same products (Iphone Max Pro v Iphone base model), there is plenty value to capture in emerging Markets (Indonesia, India, South East Asia)
* Apple's best strategy is target its products to become the 'affordable luxury good', just expensive enough to be within reach, but near the limit of what people would be willing to spend for a phone
* Regulatory Risk non-existent: I find the American obsession over what their government's actions are to be highly irrational, Governments across the world have shown a complete ineptitutde in regulating and stopping the progress of Tech companies. Likewise for Apple, one of the most valuable companies in the world, is the American Government really trying to destroy that?
